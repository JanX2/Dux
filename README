Dux is a simple code editor for Mac OS X.

It follows the new document architecture in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, including full auto-save and version history.

The app is currently functional and stable, but missing many features expected of a good code editor. The current goal is to implement those basic features, then release as version 1.0.

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.
